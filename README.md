# Pomodoro Application

![Design preview for Tic Tac Toe Game](./design/desktop-design.jpg)

This is a Pomodoro application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application helps users manage their time using the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. The technique uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
